# String Calculator

Write a simple calculator that can perform basic arithmetic operations on a string of numbers. Here is an outline of the requirements:

1. In the file called "StringCalculator" create a function called "Add" that takes a string as an input.

2. "Add" should return 0 if the input string is empty.

3. If the input string contains a single number, then "Add" should return that number.

4. If the input string contains multiple numbers, separated by a comma or newline, then "Add" should return the sum of those numbers.

5. "Add" should handle negative numbers, and throw an exception if any negative numbers are found in input string.

6. "Add" should ignore numbers greater than 1000.

7. "Add" should support custom delimiters, indicated by a "//" prefix before the numbers.
