# FizzBuzz Kata

1. Write a program that prints out the numbers from 1 to 100. (console.log)

2. For multiples of three, print "Fizz" instead of the number.

3. For multiples of five, print "Buzz" instead of the number.

4. For multiples of both three and five, print "FizzBuzz" instead of the number.

> Hint: To make things easier to test. Separate the function doing the loop from 1-100 from the function which determines what to print.
